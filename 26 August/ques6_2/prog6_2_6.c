// Write a C program that takes an 8-bit unsigned integer (0â€“255) as input and displays
// the count of 1 bits in its binary representation. The program should use only bitwise
// operators and arithmetic, without using any control structures.
// Hint: For an unsigned char, check each bit individually by shifting and masking,
// then sum the results in a single expression.
